# Drawer Organizer

Parametric 3d design for a modular drawer organizer. See
https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3827538 for examples.

It is intended to be used with FDM 3D printers.

## Printing Instructions

I used the following settings:
* 0.4mm nozzle
* two perimeters
* two bottom layers
* zero infill for most parts, the long divider get 3% to avoid bulges
* remove elephant foot 0.15mm

I printed parts with PLA for the first tests and PETG for the final thing. Both worked fine.

Other people successfully used:
* 0.8mm extrusion width
* 1 perimeter

to speed up printing.
